# CS237
Puzzles, RSA, &amp; more... All written in the language of Emacs Lisp!

Our teacher insisted we used Emacs Lisp and Org mode for all of our write ups. By no means, did I willingly choose to do this all in Lisp. But I guess here's proof I knew enough at one point in my life.

Coolness was our first project exploring predicates. There are a bunch of school exercises, too. The discrete vs. continous puzzle was actually kind of fun. You'll see I actually solved it using Excel the first time and my teacher did not like that. So then I did it in C++ and he still did not like that. :/

I included an intro to Emacs Lisp I found because it took me a while to find it. Just in case you now have a burning desire to learn it.

## RSA
Wellness is an RSA implementation, but it only works with words 3 characters long or less - because the numbers get too big and I don't handl overflow and because Emacs Lisp is hard.
