* TWO.JKL Exercises

** UTT - Use This Thing 

We have basic things like the addition rule and the multiplication
rule. We can do great things with this.
   
We are given this equation for the number of permutations of n
things taken r at a time.
   
P(n,r) = n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3) ... (n - r + 1) = n! / (n-r)!
   
Here is my idea of a proof. I know that this should be done
algebraically, so we'll see how well I can do this.

We are taken r items from the sample. For the first r, we have n
possiblities. The next will have n-1, then n-2, so we will multiple
all those together. We stop when we have done r items - which is when
that last r is equivalent to n - r + 1. We effectively are taking n!
and truncating the lower parts of it. I will here give a numerical
example.

Say n = 9, r = 3.

9 * (9 - 1) * (9 - 2) gives us the possiblities for the first three
items (which is all we need). Notice, the reason we subtract one each
time is because we are not replacing the items.

If we take 9! (9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) and divide from it so that only
9*8*7 is left. We need 6! in the denominator. How convenient, 9 - 3 =
6. Using that, we can always truncate the bottom ones we don't need.
   
Therefore,
   
n! / (n-r)!
   
** OWE - Oscar Wins Everything

0! is defined to be 1. Mathematics has made it so, though that
isn't really an explanation. As far as I have been able to gather, 0!
is sort of a scalar identity for factorials. Matrices, and other
things that satisfy the vector space rules, have their scalar
indentity. I imagine this is very much the same, though I can't
conclude if factorials constitutes a vector space.
   
If we have simple permutations of n = 9, the equation is simple and
the total is 362880. If we apply the equation for n = 9, taken 9 at a
time (r), the denominator (n-r)! would be 0!. It can't be be 0,
because we can't divide by zero. Therefore, 0! is an identity and
evaluates to 1.

** UTS - Umbrella Terminal Sickness

ABCDELMNO is our set. There are 362880 possible arrangements (no
replacement, order matters).

How many contain the string ELM?

At first, I had no idea how to tackle this. I wrote some c++ to
enumerate all the permutations and returned a count for each one that
included the string "ELM." The result was 5040. I am confident this is
the right answer and I am also confident this is possibly the second
worst way to do this exercise, the worst being a sad attempt to do it
by hand.

I spoke with Matt Bloomfield. He is a wizard. He pointed out the "ELM"
becomes on identity and that really reduces the set to 7 items: "ELM"
"A" "B" "C" "D" "N" "O"

The problem is now trivial. The possible combinations is 7! which is
5040. This is our set we want and it is really a subset of the 362880
arrangements.

** UTA - Utah Transit Authority

P(n,r) = n! / (n-r)! C(n,r) = n! / ((n-r)!r!)

There typically are less combinations then there are permutations, the
reason being that for one combination, there can be multiple
permutations. The basic equaitons are listed above. The main
difference is that r! in the denominator for combinations. If that
number is greater than 1, it will cause the total number of
combinations to be less than permutations. Therefore, the only case
combinations isn't less then permutations is when we choose r = 1,
(assuming r can't be zero or negative).

** OWN - Ordinary Wizarding Nerd

How many TLAs (arrangements of 3 alphabetic letters) are there with
repetition allowed?

There are 26 since letters in our alphabet. If repition is allowed,
the multiplication rule leads us to compute that the total
permutations is 26 * 26 * 26 (26 possibilities for each position).

26^3 = 17,576 total possible arrangements

I feel like this is too simple.

** OED - Overt Energy Dispatchers

"Sequence" means what? order matters, repitition is allowed ?

As far as I've been able to gleam, a sequence would mean that order
matter and that repitition is allowed. For this promt, we take two
seperate events (OR) and we add them together.
   
For people with two initials, the possible sequences totals 26 * 26
= 676. For people with three initials, the possible sequences totals
26*26*26 = 17,576

The total different sequences then would be 676 + 17,576 = 18,252

** OMI - Onion Must Iterate

How many different sequences can be formed using either two or
three letters (A-Z) followed by either two or three digits (0-9)?
   
There should be 4 general cases that we will have to consider and
since they are all possible (OR) they will all be added together for
the total.
   
   1. 2let & 2dig 
      - letters: 26 * 26 = 676 
      - digits: 10 * 10 = 100 
      - total: 67,600 
   2. 2let & 3dig
      - letters: 26 * 26 = 676
      - digits: 10 * 10 * 10 = 1,000
      - total: 676,000
   3. 3let & 2dig
      - letters: 26 * 26 * 26 = 17,576
      - digits: 10 * 10 = 100
      - total: 1,757,600 
   4. 3let & 3dig
      - letters: 26 * 26 = 17,576
      - digits: 10 * 10 * 10 = 1,000
      - total: 17,576,000

67,600 + 676,000 + 1,757,600 + 17,576,000 = 20,077,200 total different
sequences.

** UMS - UHHHMMMMSSSSSS 

FILL IN THE ;;...

I'm really not sure what this is asking. Event and space will
probably be passed in as a integer and a straight divide will only
return 0 or 1. They will have to be cast into floats. That can be done
with the following code, which is now modified.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(defun probability (event space)
  "A function that takes an event and a space and returns a number between 0 and 1."
  (let ((result (/ (float event) (float space))))
    resultt
    ))
#+END_SRC

** OEK - Ordinary Expressions Kill

Generalize the above to deal with the experiment of flipping 2n
coins. Find the probability of the event that n will be heads, and n
will be tails. Your answer should be a function of n.

If we're looking for the events of n heads or tails in n size space,
then the number of time that even happens can only be one for each
case so the probability would be 1 over the space. The space would be
2^n because there are two options for each flip. Therefore, the
equation is: 

1/(2^n)

** ORD - Object Routed Dancing

What is the probability that when randomly selecting a permutation of
the 26 letters (assumed all uppercase) of the alphabet the following
events will occur:

The first 13 letters will be in alphabetical order.

I will first define the space size out of these 26 permutations. This
will be used as the denominator for the probailites in each case. The
space size is 26! = HUGE. Just kidding, it is 403291461126605635584000000.

If we consider the event of the first 13 letter in alphabetical order,
we can just treat "ABCDEFGHIJKLM" as one item and the remainer will be
13! different permutations. The equation would thus be 

13!/26! which gives us .00000000000000001544 as the probability of the
happening. This isn't very high.

** ORG - Orange Racing Games

The first and last letters will be B and Y.

Same concept as above, we are left with 24 characters to permuate in
the middle so the equation becomes

24!/26! = .001538

This is much more likely.

** ORS - Office Rights Signing

The letter I will come before both J and K.

I J K should be set so it is 23!/26! In the denominator, we need to
add certain times when I isn't before J and K. That means these kind
of cases:

... I J K
... I .. J K
We have to account for the permutations where I is not the most left
so the times JK are on the right of it will not work. I propose thatit
is half the time because the other half of the time they stay on the
right. So the equation should be:

23!/(26!*2) = .00003205

** UFO - Unidentified Flying Object

The letters O and P will be next to each other.

12  23  34...
OP  OP  OP...
PO  PO  PO...

The remaining of course being filled with 24! There are 25 positions
OP/PO can be in. 2 different cases for each slot so the equation we
are left with is:

(50*24!)/26! = .07692

** UVW - Unprecedented Villian Wishes

The letters U and V will be separated by at least 23 letters.

  U ....... V
  U ....... V .
. U ....... V .
  V ....... U
  V ....... U .
. V ....... U

There are 6 different cases where this is true. The remaining ...'s
can be computed by the remaining amount of letters left (24). So for
each case, there is 24! possible combinations. The equation is thus:

(6 * 24!)/26! = .009231

Matthew Bloomfield & Aaron Pobst helped me a bit where I was stuck and explained
certain things.
