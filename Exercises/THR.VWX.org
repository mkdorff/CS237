** TWA

How does allowing cycles imply the existence of more than one path
from one node to another?

The book defines a cycle as a path from a node back to itself. If
nothing else, the initial node will have to have at least two edges to
two nodes and those two have an edge connecting them. It would form a
triangle. So, the existence of a cycle would force at least two paths
from one node to another. If we have A, B, & C, A to C would be one
path and A to B to C would be another. Obviously as we increase the
number of nodes in the graph it would only add to the number of paths.

What is the degree sequence of the Intermountain West adjoining states
graph?

We have to list the degrees of all the nodes in nonincreasing order.

| MT | ID | WY | NV | UT | CO | AZ | NM |
|  2 |  4 |  4 |  3 |  5 |  3 |  3 |  2 |

Now in the form we need: [5 4 4 3 3 3 2 2]

** WET

What can you say about a graph if all you know is its degree sequence?

At the very least, we know how many nodes are in the graph and how
many edges there are. I think a degree sequence is unique per graph
though I can't prove it. So we have a skeleton to a graph and general
relationships between vertices if it is unqiue. I believe the fact
that the sum of all the vertices is twice the number of edges helps
prove that.

** TEE

Any undirected graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree.



** WER

Is there (can there exist) a graph with degree sequence [3 2 1 0]?
Justify your answer.

No. Mainly because I tried for about 20 minutes to draw a graph with
that degree sequence. To try to prove it though, we have to have 4
nodes. One of them isn't connected to any thing and the first one is
needs to be connected to 3 nodes. It can only be connected to 2
because of the last stated reason so this graph can not exist.

** TMI

How many edges are there in Cn, as a function of n?

The number of edges on Cn = n. That is seemingly by definition.

** WEG

How many edges are there in Wn?

Each W graph is effectively the same as the C graph but with the extra
node in the center. I always have to o things numerically to prove it
to myself. So:

|   | 3 | 4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |
| C | 3 | 4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |
| W | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 | 14 |

This is pretty apparent laid out but Wn will always be Cn * 2 because
the extra node connects to the remaining nodes which is the number n.

** TEA

Q0 has 1 node and 0 edges. In general, Qn has 2n vertices, and how
many edges?

|       | Q0 | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 |
| EDGES |  0 |  1 |  4 | 12 | 32 |
| NODES |  1 |  2 |  4 |  8 | 16 |

We were given 2^n for the number of vertices. The edges increase but
the factor by which is increases seems to decrease.

To calculate the number of edges, we will multiple by n 
so 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
we are left with needing to get 
   0, 1, 2, 4, 8
which is easy enough. That would be 2^(n - 1)

So the general equation for Qn is 2^(n-1)*n
  

** TRY

Investigate bipartite graphs and complete bipartite graphs. What kinds
of applications fit these types of graphs?

All the explanations online are hard. Hopefully, the way I understand
it si correct and simpler. Simply said, a bipartite graph is a graph
that can have two distinct sets and each vertex in a set is connected
to another in the other set. A complete bipartite graph is an
extension of such where on vertex in a set is connected to all
vertices of the next set. The buzz word affiliation network was used,
but it is here very applicable. Whenever there are two different
classes of objects, this can show the relationship between the two.

** WID

The intersection of two graphs â€” what can you say about that?

If we are looking for an intersection, we have to take each node from
one graph and see if it corresponds with a node from the other graph
(which includes the number of edges it has). If we were to right it in
terms of its degree sequence, we would see one as a subset of the
other. For example, [5 4 4 4 3 1 1] [3 1 1] This sort of thing. I
don't think those are real graphs but that illustrates the point.

** WIT

What does it mean to say that VWX has ([2 1 1] [2 2 2 1 1] [4 1 1 1
1]) as its list of degree sequences?

This means that the entity titled VWX is actually 3 different
graphs. It would look something like this.

    A          D             
   / \         |            
  B   C        E             
               |         
               F             
               |
               G
               |
               H

Aaron Pobst and Matthew Bloomfield helped out whenever I was a little
lost. Especially on TEA, I was lost on that one.
