* 2.4.1.1 UOU

  The possible binary realtions of a set of three elements I presume to be 27. I searched for how exactly this is supposed to be done completely, but I can't find an answer. But using a = {1, 2, 3} as an example, we can only have the following: {(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,1) (3,2) (3,3)} which would be 9 or 3^2. The pattern follow for bigger sets. Also, we were supposed to just replace the ... in the lisp code, but n and size both are functions so I'm not sure what they're supposed to be doing there. But if we let n become the size of the set the code should only need to be altered so that n is squared.

* 2.4.2.1 OUT

I am to argue about the next four sets. I will use examples of the numbers in the set.

** R

R is reflexive solely because all x are members of its set. It is symmetric becuase order doesn't make a differnce. It isn't antisymmetric because any x does equal y so x not equal y isn't true. It is transitive.

** S

S is not reflexive because 1 does not equal 2.
S is not symmetric because again, 1 does not equal 2. Order matters here and elements are different.
S is antisymetric because x always does not equal y. No where is there and x that equals y.
I don't know about transistive.

** T

T is not reflexive because x and y's are always different.
T is not symmetic for much the same reason. x and y are always different.
T is antisymmetric because x always does not equal y. No where is there and x that equals y.
I don't know about transistive.

** U

U is not reflexive because the x's and y's are always different.
U is not symmetic for much the same reason. x and y are always different.
U is antisymmetric because x always does not equal y. No where is there and x that equals y.
I don't know about transistive.
